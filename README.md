### Introduction

Evaly is a Python library aimed at XYZ. This library makes it simple to do things like XYZ and ABC.

---

### Installation

Install `evaly` using pip:

```bash
pip install evaly
```

Or clone the repository and install manually:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/evaly.git
cd evaly
python setup.py install
```

### Quick Start

Here's a simple example that demonstrates how to XYZ:

### API Key Generation

1. **Visit Our Website**: Navigate to `https://our-website.com/api-keys`.
2. **Login/Signup**: If you haven't already, create an account or log in.
3. **Dashboard**: Go to the API section.
4. **Generate API Key**: Click on the 'Generate API Key' button.
5. **Name Your Key**: Give your API key a name so you can remember what it's used for.
6. **Copy Key**: Once generated, make sure to copy and store it somewhere safe. You won't be able to view it again.

**Note**: Keep your API key secret. Never expose it in client-side code or public repositories.

---
```python
import evaly

# Initialize the client
client = evaly.Client(api_key='YOUR_API_KEY')

# Perform some operation
result = client.some_method()
```

### API Endpoints

Here are some of the API endpoints and how to use them:

```python
# Example 1
response = client.endpoint_one(arg1, arg2)

# Example 2
response = client.endpoint_two(arg1)
```

### Error Handling

`evaly` uses standard HTTP response codes to indicate the success or failure of an API request. Here are some common codes you may encounter:

- `200 OK`: The request was successful.
- `400 Bad Request`: The request was invalid.
- `401 Unauthorized`: Authentication failed, you might have used an invalid API key.
